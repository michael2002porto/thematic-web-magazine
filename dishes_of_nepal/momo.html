    <h3><li>Preparation</li></h3></ol>
    <ul><h4><li>Dough</li></h4><br>
    <p>
        Combine flour, oil, salt and water in a bowl. Mix and knead till the dough becomes homogeneous in texture, it may take about 10-12 minutes. It is better to cover dough and wait for 30 min before you make wrappers. Don’t forget to knead well before start making wrappers.
    </p>
    <br><h4><li>Filling</li></h4><br>
    <p>
        In a large bowl combine all filling ingredients. Stir well, adjust for seasoning with salt and pepper. Cover and allow at least half an hour to mix and impart their unique flavors completely. 
    </p>
    <br><h4><li>Making/Wrapping</li></h4><br>
    <p>
        Give the dough a final knead. Prepare 1-in. dough balls. Take a ball, roll between your palms to spherical shape. Dust working board with dry flour. On the board gently flatten the ball with your palm to about 2-in circle. Make a few semi-flattened circles, cover with a bowl. Use a rolling pin to roll out each flattened circle into a wrapper.
 
To make momo-cha better, it is important that the middle portion of the wrapper be slightly thicker than the edges to ensure the structural integrity of dumplings during packing and steaming. Hold the edges of the semi-flattened dough with one hand and with the other hand begin rolling the edges of the dough out, swirling a bit at a time. Continue until the wrapper attains 3-in diameter circular shape. Repeat with the remaining semi-flattened dough circles.
