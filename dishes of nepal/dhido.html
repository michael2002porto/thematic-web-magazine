    <p>  
        Dhido is a typical Nepali dish that is commonly served in the country's hilly regions. It is everyday food for many people in rural parts of Nepal which looks like pudding and is eaten with achar and curries.

        This is generally prepared with wheat flour and is considered to be healthy food. Some people also use corn flour or ground grains to make Dhido. Due to the lack of spices in Dhido, it is thought to be tasteless, yet many people enjoy its natural taste. It is light food and also it is long-lasting as people do not feel hungry very soon after eating Dhido.
        
        Dhido is also considered pure food to be consumed during a fast because it does not require the addition of salt or vegetable oil.
        
        Nowadays, the Dhilo meal set is easily available in many restaurants with different side dishes around the cities.</p>
    <br><h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Wheat Flour (or cornflour if you want)</li>
        <li>1 L water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large saucepan add four cups of water and a large pinch of salt. Then, bring it to a boil. </li>
        <li>When the water is heated, pour the flour into the water and stir the meal slowly and steadily with the left hand.</li>
        <li>Thoroughly blend, to make sure no lumps in the mixture are present. Continuous stirring avoids any lumps.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue to swirl until the mixture has a dense texture, and its grainy texture has been lost.</li>
        <li>Make sure that the blend is warm, not runny, and not dry. When the Dhindo is able to separate the porridge from the side of the pot, itâ€™s ready.</li>
        <li>Remove from other pot, sprinkle with clarified butter, and whisk until well combined. Put the Dhindo on the plate or directly and eat while it is warm.
        </li>
