            "Abang bakso, come here, I want to buy". That's a fragment of a children's song popularized by Melisa during
            the 90s. Because of the deliciousness of meatballs, the presence of a meatball brother is always awaited.

            Meatballs are processed from ground beef, mixed with spices, flour, and flavorings. The dough is formed into
            balls and then boiled until cooked.

            Meatballs are served with beef broth and complementary ingredients such as yellow noodles, rice noodles,
            tofu meatballs, and chopped celery leaves.

            Nowadays, meatballs have been modified to include cheese meatballs, cayenne meatballs, meatballs with kids,
            egg meatballs, and jumbo-sized meatballs. Don't forget to eat meatballs along with soy sauce, sauce or chili
            sauce.
