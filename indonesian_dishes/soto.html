            Soto, Coto, Sauto, Tauto is a type of Indonesian soup with chicken or beef stew. Soto usually uses two types
            of meat, chicken and beef.

            Chicken soto has a yellowish broth with a savory and fragrant taste. The yellow color is due to turmeric,
            shallots, garlic as the basic spices. While meat soto is usually clear in color or coconut milk.

            Soto can be found in every region, especially on the island of Java. There are many variants of soto in
            Indonesia, one of which is Soto Lamongan, Soto Kudus, Soto Betawi, Soto Bandung, Soto Padang, Soto Jepara,
            Soto Banjar, Coto Makasar, etc.

            fried soy beans, Soto Kudus is served with boiled bean sprouts, Soto Lamongan is served with sliced cabbage,
            tomatoes and koya, etc.

            spices contained in a bowl of soto can restore stamina and warm the body.
